# The purpose of this script is to attempt to fix the issue of not having internet when
# using bash as part of Windows Subsystem for Linux. This particular script will place
# 192.168.1.1 at the top of your /etc/resolv.conf file (assuming your router is your DNS server)

# backup existing resolv.conf and unlink
cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.new
unlink /etc/resolv.conf

# Overwrite the previous resolv.conf
mv /etc/resolv.conf.new /etc/resolv.conf

# remove the first line of resolv.conf and manually add vpn dns server to top of file
